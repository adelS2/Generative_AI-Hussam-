# A Practical Introduction to Generative AI

This repository contains the materials and plan for a 10-day practical course on Generative AI. The course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of various generative models, their applications, and hands-on experience in building and deploying these models.

## Main Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Generative AI**: Overview of VAEs, GANs, Transformers, LLMs, and ethical considerations.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Fundamentals, latent variables, and practical implementation.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Architecture, training challenges, and advanced variants.
- **Transformers**: Self-attention mechanism, encoder-decoder model, and practical applications.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Overview of GPT, BERT, pre-training, fine-tuning, and transfer learning.
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Best practices for integrating cloud-based models.
- **Hugging Face Ecosystem**: Using Transformers, Datasets, and Model Hub for generative tasks.
- **Capstone Project**: Developing an end-to-end generative AI application and project presentations.
